# Missing the point

As we explore the idea of maximizing science for impact, it is useful to look for examples we can learn from. This chapter explores cases where a developing crisis which, has strong scientific underpinnings, is unfolding, yet we fail to use these to inform a proper reaction to solve the crisis.
As we will see, a key common thread, as I pointed out in the previous chapter, is the misalignment of missions. On one side, we have the research incentive where a scientist is trained, and rewarded, for understanding the process itself, on scarce and restrictive funding mechanisms that prioritize the quickest and most likely to succeed fields. On the other hand, we have complex multi-factor multi-stakeholder unknown pathways to solve the crisis, that must include not only research and scientific understanding, but also deal with social taboos, profit incentives, public perceptions and political capital.  

We could, for example, talk about scurvy, a disease that killed millions of sailors on long sea trips, often a substantial percentage of the crew, forcing to abandon ships, reroute or cancel ongoing expeditions. On Magellan´s first circumnavigation of the world in 1619-1522 half the crew died from it, and it is estimated many more would have were it not for other causes, likes fights or storms . Today we know this terrible and widespread disease in sailors results for Vitamin C deficiency. Throughout history, however, the prevention and cure of scurvy has been known and forgotten many times, and consisted of simply eating citric fruits (like lemons or oranges), or fresh meat. In 1747 James Lind, a Scottish physician, scientifically proved that to be the case with a clinical trial, and published it in a few paragraphs on a long and complex book in 1753 (“A Treatise on the Scurvy”). Yet the, prevailing knowledge was that it was a consequence of the sailor´s hard life. Moreover, the logistics and economic pressures to supply fresh fruits to all ships, prevented any significant change informed on this scientific knowledge. Meanwhile the academic leadership remained unscientifically stubborn to accept the evidence, and historical cures. This included the highest institutions, such as the president of the Royal Academic Society (1772-1778) Sir John Pringle who blamed scurvy on bad digestion that could be cured drinking malt. Science, as a body of knowledge had proven and registered the right answer, but there was no real impact or mechanism to implement a solution. Not until 1795, when a British admiral, guided by the rumors and ineffectiveness of the prevailing treatment, used his authority to order a daily ration of lime juice on his 4-month long trip. The ship arrived with no trace of scurvy, which prompted a Navy wide policy to secure and supply large quantities of lemon juice. The health improvement of the crew and strategic advantage to the fleet operations played a critical role to the Royal Navy against enemies, that had yet to implement this simple but effective measure. In this case, the scientific corpus of knowledge knew about it, but lack the power or implementation strategy to drive impact from the knowledge. It could only wait and confirm the effectiveness when the change happened through other means.
