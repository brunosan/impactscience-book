* 1: It’s a known fact that the retreat is because of the effects of
    climate change.       https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas\_Vieli/publication/235640596\_Large-scale\_changes\_in\_Greenland\_outlet\_glacier\_dynamics\_triggered\_at\_the\_terminus/links/54200b420cf241a65a1afaf0/Large-scale-changes-in-Greenland-outlet-glacier-dynamics-triggered-at-the-terminus.pdf
* 2: It’s more than just breath ancient air, the bubbles gives us a lot
    of information about evolution of the ice and its history.       https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/207477CB49617C926A111C331AA69F4A/S002214300001279Xa.pdf/significance\_of\_air\_bubbles\_in\_glacier\_ice.pdf
* 3: The documentary “Bending the arch” depicts this progress, from
    setting the organization to when he joined the World Bank Group as
    president. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending\_the\_Arc
* 4: http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/27/is-jim-yong-kim-destroying-the-world-bank-development-finance/
* 5: The original paper describing the business model and several
    potential areas for implementation was published in 2016, and
    available here
    <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X16300586>
    Enric has also spoken about the concept on several Ted talks and
    interviews.
* 6: The phrase, coined in 1994, refers to much more than profit and
    loss, to full cost accounting.

* 7: Bhutan is a small community with a strong national identity and
    union. This means that, despite long windy roads and times to
    connect across the country, communities are closely united. My
    experience was that everyone knew someone in the region or place you
    were asking about for the mapping exercise; or the knew exactly who
    to call. As way of reference, this is reflected e.g. on this
    interview about soccer
    https://www.npr.org/2015/03/17/393646668/bhutan-one-step-closer-to-world-cup-after-shocking-victory-over-sri-lanka?t=1535798543478
* 8: There are many reported cases of misuse of mosquito nets used for
    fishing, not only around the Malawi lake, but also other regions.
    This is a good summary of the situation, in 2016

* 10: See article on the scurvy here, and references therein:       https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8852139/Mayberry.html
* 11: The time of HIV/AIDS cases is a well-researched topic, with many
    nuisances and complexities, like the different types of HIV, the
    effect of public policies, the inter-relation with the
    socio-economic, cultural and political factors of each country. For
    this part I based my research in sources quoted on Wikipedia
    articles, this article about relation of gay sexual practices
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8030625 . the book “The Band
    Played on” and this article about possible sources of the USA being
    hit particularly hard and fast:
    https://newrepublic.com/article/117691/aids-hit-united-states-harder-other-developed-countries-why
* 12: Estimates for how many people received contaminated Factor VIII
    range substantially, and also across many countries. This also
    includes spreading of other diseases, like Hepatitis C. References
    to estimates and disputes around these cases can be found e.g. here:       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated\_haemophilia\_blood\_products\#cite\_note-NYTimes1996-1
* 13: You can hear here the cut of when it happened:\

* 14: Francis, Donald P. "Deadly AIDS policy failure by the highest
    levels of the US government: A personal look back 30 years later for
    lessons to respond better to future epidemics." *Journal of Public
    Health Policy* 33 (2012): 290-300.

* 20: In May 2017 Nature published a study on the detection of
    increasing CFC-11 with unknown origin. This is still research in
    progress and unknown if the source CFC is newly made or the leakage
    of stored appliances, but the findings are conclusive of an
    increased emission in the recent years that.

* 22: The good news of reduced child mortality across the World is one
    of the key messages Dr. Hans Rossling became famous for. For more
    context-setting and the relation with education and development in
    general, his TED talk is a good pointer for more information: \*

* 24: At the time of the acquisition, the so-called deep artificial
    intelligence applied on images was on its earliest stages. Today
    these features are much common. I learned about the backstory of
    Magic Pony and how it came to be from one of the VC funders, and was
    widely reported in 2016:
