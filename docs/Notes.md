 The phrase, coined in 1994, refers to much more than profit and loss, to full cost accounting. http://www.johnelkington.com/archive/TBL-elkington-chapter.pdf

### iv

 Bhutan is a small community with a strong national identity and union. This means that, despite long windy roads and times to connect across the country, communities are closely united. My experience was that everyone knew someone in the region or place you were asking about for the mapping exercise; or the knew exactly who to call. As way of reference, this is reflected e.g. on this interview about soccer https://www.npr.org/2015/03/17/393646668/bhutan-one-step-closer-to-world-cup-after-shocking-victory-over-sri-lanka?t=1535798543478

 The time of HIV/AIDS cases is a well-researched topic, with many nuisances and complexities, like the different types of HIV, the effect of public policies, the inter-relation with the socio-economic, cultural and political factors of each country. For this part I based my research in sources quoted on Wikipedia articles, this article about relation of gay sexual practices https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8030625 . the book 'The Band Played on' and this article about possible sources of the USA being hit particularly hard and fast: https://newrepublic.com/article/117691/aids-hit-united-states-harder-other-developed-countries-why

### viii

 Estimates for how many people received contaminated Factor VIII range substantially, and also across many countries. This also includes spreading of other diseases, like Hepatitis C. References to estimates and disputes around these cases can be found e.g. here:

In May 2017 Nature published a study on the detection of increasing CFC-11 with unknown origin. This is still research in progress and unknown if the source CFC is newly made or the leakage of stored appliances, but the findings are conclusive of an increased emission in the recent years that. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0106-2.epdf
