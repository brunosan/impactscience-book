# Introduction
Facts don’t change the world, people do. We are creating a world
dominated more and more by data and technology, and where fewer and
fewer know how to use it. Companies sit on top of vast amounts of data
and so do governments, NGOs, and academia. But it is not the data, it is
what we do with it.

Historically, we started having scientists seeking and producing most of
the data to do research, to publish papers, to *understand*.
Understanding has been the core of the scientific revolution, guided by
the “free play of the free intellect.” Roughly a decade ago, the private
sector, especially in Silicon Valley, wanted help making decisions, more
than it wanted understanding and research papers. It wanted, for
example, to put thousands of small variations of websites to millions of
people, and see what combinations work. They were not really interested
in understanding why a particular option worked, but on optimizing. On
profiling customers. This is why a new breed of scientist—experts in
processing data—was born: the data scientists. We could not have enough,
so more and more people became data scientists. Today data science is
one of the most demanded and rapidly evolving job markets. Yet, it has
no formal training, curricula, or even an agreed-upon definition. The
skills and tools of this job, heavily subsidized by the private sector´s
thirst for more results, and the fast cadence of technology, are
creating ever better, more complex and powerful tools.

An increasing number of people start to see the problem with this trend
focusing on better decisions by mostly getting more data and data-driven
decisions. Before, we had scientists in knowledge silos, working on
creating better skills and tools in their quest for understanding. Now
we have data scientists, creating even better skills and tools in
decision making. Data can tell us that a certain genetic mutation in our
genes predicts more health care complications and extra cost, though
morals (and history) warn us against selectively and genetically
breeding and optimizing our kids. Data can tells us that a robot can
perform heart surgery more accurately than a person, but few would allow
being operated on by only autonomous robots. Data can tell us exactly
what message each voter should get so they vote a particular political
candidate, but manipulating voters in a democracy this way has poorly
understood consequences we only now start to understand… Data is what
scientists are trained to manage and understand, and data is what we
have exponentially more of, therefore there is an increasing potential
and responsibility for scientists to both step in and step out. Step in
to engage not only in academics, but also with the consequences and
actions. Step out to incorporate and work with experts in other fields
and in other realities. For far too long, scientists have built ivory
towers where they live in their segmented field of expertise.

####### For whom is this book?

Getting a grasp of the concept of *impact science* has personally been a
long path. When I left academia, it was a difficult choice, and remained
for many years a challenging time of uncertainty whether I had done the
right thing or not. Looking back at those times I wish I knew that there
is a professionally viable, market-growing, and extremely interesting
world of science outside academia. I wish I knew leaving academia
doesn´t mean giving up the “top choice” or that doing so did not mean
that I was not good enough. I felt, and was told by a famous political
scientist, that society had “invested in me” with a lot of specialized
education and I was not using it as I should. That from a public policy
perspective, I was a wasted investment. Beyond that, I had no idea what
else I could do, where to do it, or how to make that transition happen.
This made me feel anxious and frustrated. Moreover, the longer a
scientist remains in academia, the harder this transition is. The cost
of such transition away from research is facing uncertain rules of your
professional value. Losing the hard-earned status one has achieved
despite the hardships of academia. These can be very hard moments. I can
count more than a handful of colleagues who once were good or really
good academics, and faced with this change, they turned into a spiral of
medicated depressions, clinical anxiety, and unmet expectations. In the
more severe cases, it also meant periods of professional help at mental
health institutions or even struggling with suicidal thoughts. So
alienating is the way that academia defines success as a scientist. I
have since discovered many more people that craved for this change, and
found other ways to be a successful scientist while leaving academia, by
being what we would call *impact scientists*.

There are two main reasons I wrote this book. One is that I believe
impact science is a new concept that is both needed and unknown, perhaps
even undefined. I have used the stories of this book to explore this
space and the need of more impact science. On both sides, when it is
needed and successfully used, and when it could have been used and
didn’t, or it failed when applied. That is the first part of this book.

The second reason for writing this book is that I wish I could have read
back when I left academia. The last section of the book is meant for all
those who have an academic background but feel something is missing.
They still want to be scientists, but haven’t yet found their place. Or
for their friends and family who want to understand the reason, and
path, for such an uncommon and dramatic change from a “normal”
scientist. These people curious about impact science wish to engage more
with the world beyond academic or public outreach articles. They are
tired of the pressures and uncertainties of the academic life and cycle
of temporal postdocs, moving countries every two years or so, but they
truly don´t know how to even think of alternatives.
