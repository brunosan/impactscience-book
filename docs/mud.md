# From Numbers in the Computer Screen to Mud on your Toes

Even before finishing my PhD I had doubts. I loved science, but somehow
academia felt less interesting. For most people, myself included back
then, science and academia refer to the same concept. You do science
working either on basic research or applied research, which mostly
correlates respectively with either creating new knowledge within
publicly funded institutions or finding applications of the new
knowledge at the private sector. That is it. My neck of the woods was
basic research. PhD in solar physics at one of the highest regarded
institutions in the world, the Max Planck. The message there was clear:
here we make top researchers. I still remember the “Career Day”
PowerPoint presentation at one of the retreats where the narrative was
that only the best get to stay in academia, while saying that staying in
academia is the highest goal for scientists: If Option A wasn’t working,
option B was far below in status and not really an option, but something
for those failing option A to consider.

When I finished my PhD, I was proud, but I was also uneasy about the
normative academic path ahead. I followed the advice of a friend and
interviewed at a major consulting firm (McKinsey). Incidentally this was
also the time the European Space Agency did the Astronaut Selection and
I was part of the selection process. I remember that during the tests
and interviews in both cases, my scientific skills were highly regarded,
more even than the scientific knowledge. They liked the problem solving
and hypothesis attitude, more than knowing the laws of plasma dynamics.
I also cold-emailed the three top academic places in the USA I cloud
think of. They were not a continuation of my PhD work, but I also
realized once I leave academia, I could not come back, so this was my
only chance to give it a last shot. I ended up going to one of these,
the rocket lab in Washington DC.

I worked as a postdoc for two years, kept writing papers, going to
conferences, and doing occasional public outreach, like organizing
global events for the “2009 International Year of Astronomy.” Outreach
was in a sense the most fulfilling activity, but the research itself was
the most exciting and challenging. The discontent with this hard choice
grew and I decided to leave at the end of my second year in the postdoc.
Leaving this job is one of the most difficult things I have done. It was
fascinating to work with satellites and rockets, at a top institution in
the world. For someone who comes from a small rural village in northern
Spain, it is a long way from home. Moreover, I had no idea what else to
do. I felt like I was climbing higher and higher a tall mountain, but it
was not the mountain I wanted to climb. To climb the mountain I liked, I
had to find it, and I also had to go back down to the lowest part and
start again. I applied for, and won, a three months science policy
fellowship at the National Academies. My rocket science boss candidly
told me he thought it was a mistake if I wanted to stay in academia. I
remember being very nervous even asking him to let me go. Academia is
very unforgiving, pausing my research and publication cadence could have
huge impact in my academic credentials. On top of that, as a
non-American I needed his permission to attend the Fellowship while
keeping my work visa.

The Fellowship was great to open the eyes beyond academia and into what
science policy is. Most of my cohort of policy fellows were in the same
spot of recent PhDs wanting to leave academia and not sure how. At the
end of the three months I had to go back to the lab. Instead, I told my
boss I was leaving. I would lose my work visa, my right to stay in the
USA, and it also meant the end of my academic career. I had few weeks to
get out the country or find a job, somewhere, somehow. My boss didn´t
really support that decision, but he said he saw it coming, accepted it,
and was keen to help me figure out what I actually wanted.

The USA is known for giving people a chance if you work hard: the
“American dream.” I also knew that my country, Spain, was deep at the
time (2010) in an economic crisis, so I better try out there. Turns out
finding a job in the USA is extremely hard even for a (foreign) “rocket
scientist.” Either they saw no need for one, they saw lack of “real”
experience, or they did not want the trouble to get me a work visa. In
my extreme, and now embarrassing, naivete, as plan B, I decided to go to
Africa and do science policy there. I don´t really know what I had in
mind, but since in Africa many countries speak French, I signed up to
take a French class. It turns out that one of the colleagues in class
knew of a new NGO on climate change that was just starting. I
interviewed there and got the same answer: no need for a rocket
scientist. I did, however, spend a weekend soon after drafting some
numbers for the mathematical model the NGO was working on. From my point
of view, it was very simple mathematically and it was interesting to
plug numbers of something I cared about in the real world. I had a quick
call with the executive team, and on the spot they hired me to continue
building it: I was to start working at once from Spain, fly for meetings
every two weeks, while they began the visa process right away.

I tell the story with some details, because that moment, that arrived
from a combination of serendipity and relentless attempts, is the moment
I broke the frame I was trapped, as a “scientist.” Before this moment, I
was labeled as having “no experience” outside academia; after this, I
had proven that my skills were valuable in the job market. While
preparing this book, I sat down with the NGO boss to ask him why he gave
me that chance. It turns out a big part of his trust on my potential was
that he also comes from academia, as an engineer. He sees the handicaps
many academics have when trying to work outside, but he also sees the
advantages if the person manages to adjust. In particular, it was the
capacity to talk both in deep technical terms with economic and
environmental experts, and also with journalists, politicians, and
people with no technical background. From my point of view, I was just
leaning on my science outreach experience for this. Just as many
academic scientists do, I gave talks about our work to the public. He
used an interesting term, “vertical and horizontal vision: Vertical to
go as deep or shallow as needed, adjusting the narrative, and horizontal
to engage all types of stakeholders, from theoretical mathematicians to
heads of state.” These are skills that I have worked constantly on since
leaving academia, and I believe are core to impact science. The NGO
proved not only the breakpoint to leave academia, but also a place I was
thrown to learn by doing, combining research, policy, implementation,
and marketing. The work we did on the NGO is the story I shared on the
last part of the climate change chapter.

After two years at the NGO, our data website vendor offered me to go
with them to build a new company, Mapbox. They again valued that
vertical and horizontal vision. They saw me contributing code to the
website and presenting the tool to both a climate change conservative
think-tanks, and most liberal researchers. When I also interviewed the
Mapbox CEO for this book, he pointed to what I already thought of him,
and the USA. He didn´t really care much about the degree, or the
academic research; they wanted people that got things done, the things
they needed to be done. “Points on the board” he would call it, core to
typical Silicon Valley ethos. In fact, since day one, Mapbox has been a
mix of artists, philosophers, and graduates from international
relations. Only a minority of computer science graduates. I was then the
only former academic. Moreover, I realized my academic training, while
very useful for the skills I had already used in the NGO, also came with
handicaps. For instance, as we were building a project, there were times
I realized halfway through that there was a better structure to do it,
or a better tool. In academia, it is almost always okay to start over.
In academia, the focus is on gaining understanding. In a startup it’s
always better to deliver it, and then find incremental ways for
improvement. The relentless focus on “shipping it” is another Silicon
Valley commandment. My work as Chief Scientist at the startup would
often involve having to understand new things, but always as a milestone
to deliver something. This was uncomfortable at times. It was like
running a sprint, and having a double finish line, the one you liked,
and the one that matters. As time went by, the company hired a few more
academics we had to manage, and I could absolutely feel the same
pattern. Just like the NGO boss had seen.

Years later, and having help grow the company from around ten to around
one hundred people, I moved to the World Bank. This was the first “Data
Scientist” staff position the World Bank had advertised, at the
Innovation Labs. When I also met recently with my manager while
preparing this book, he highlighted the same pattern of vertical and
horizontal vision as a key part of the hiring committee decision. It is
not common to see someone with deep technical experience, and strong
communications, able to integrate these technical skills into
non-technical processes that depend more on strategy, diplomacy, policy.
In the years I spent there, I was part of many teams working bridging
technical and non-technical aspects of development and technology: Our
work focused on how the latest technologic and scientific advances made
sense, or not, for development outcomes, in developing countries with
developing data. Managing the hyped promises and expectations on both
sides. Including my own.

The president of the World Bank, Jim Kim, with whom I could work
directly on occasions, has a very interesting background that also
reflects this attitude. When he was young, he created an organization,
‘Partners in Health’, on health care for developing countries which was
extremely critical towards the World Bank and wanted to close it as
paternalistic and theoretical, too far from the human reality of poverty
up close[3]. One of the lessons he shared in staff meetings, and on a
Forbes profile in 2016[4], is that “Finance and macroeconomics are
complicated, but you can actually learn them. The hardest thing to learn
is mud-between-your-toes, on-the-ground development work. You can’t
learn that quickly. You can’t learn that through trips where you’re
treated like a head of state. You have to have kind of done that
before.” This echoed very deeply in my idea of impact science. One can
learn physics or biology, and these gained skills do have a potential
impact in our lives, but to actually realize that impact, one needs
on-the-ground experience. You can do some impact science from the lab or
from a paper, but one must also go where the intended impact could use
some science. I perfectly remember listening to him telling this story,
and just a few days later going on a work trip to Dakar, Senegal, to
learn about their data science ecosystem, and to help grow it. I
remember traveling a few hours to a small village where an innovative
NGO, “IamtheCode,” was teaching women and girls technology and
entrepreneurship. I had so many ideas of open and free software they
could use to calculate all kinds of metrics and create data-driven
policies. I also remember with embarrassment that most people that
attended had no computers let alone laptops, neither they had good data,
nor good internet connections. I was right on the value of my ideas, but
my approach was useless. I had to mentally switch mode from a
paternalistic push, to an iterative dialogue of needs and potential,
which continues to this day. To reflect on the words of Jim Kim, the
village was too dry to have mud on their unpaved streets, but my feet
were dusty while I did my best to help create impact there, on the
ground. This is a feeling I have looked for ever since, like the story
of Bhutan I shared in the first chapter.

My time as a World Banker was a fantastic chapter that also taught me
the timeliness of impact science today. In a world with incredibly
efficient digital dividends, it is key to help leverage the latest and
most efficient science and technology trends across the globe. Like the
circular economy. Like sensors and the internet of things. Like drones.
Especially in developing economies. Especially in the constrained
context of a developing country, for development goals. Otherwise these
digital dividends, would only increase the digital divide and inequality
in the world: The developed places, with more funding, more structure,
education, and less constraints would absorb the benefits, increasing
the divide, or even leveraging it: when a person in Nairobi uses
Facebook, gets a ride with Uber, or finds a gig via TaskRabbit, part of
the benefits go to Silicon Valley. There is no technical reason it could
be precisely in the other direction, where the world would also help
drive finance to the developing world, instead to Silicon Valley. That
was my goal on one of the projects we did during the time I worked with
the World Bank in Philippines and China with regional and city planners.
Their strategy and measurement of “accessibility metrics” -how quickly
people can get to a hospital, for example- has for long been an
incredibly expensive endeavor involving expensive sensors, models, and
software. Things like cameras in traffic lights to measure rush-hour
locations and times. Meanwhile, any city today has plenty of taxi
drivers, or ride sharing apps that can use the software we created to
locally map the topology and traffic of their road and street network.
Basically using those cars providing rides to people as anonymized
traffic beacons. Moreover, much of the software used to develop this
solution comes from the open software movement developed by Silicon
Valley in their quest for their own apps and services. In a real and
beautiful sense these improved data science tools help reduce the
digital divide, not just increase it.

There are many other examples of scientists doing this journey from
academic science to impact science. The Spanish marine biologist Enric
Sala beautifully personifies another such case. He was an academic of
marine reserves, environmental protection studies and climate change.
After his PhD, in 2000, he got a prestigious position as professor at
one of the top academic places on his field, at the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. Years later, in 2007, at an
even more distinguished institution of National Council for Scientific
Research (CSIC), back in Spain. During these years he was fully
dedicated to publishing the importance of marine conservation, the
effects of climate change and ever-increasing details of the decreasing
health of very vulnerable oceans, wild marine life, and coasts around
the world. As he told me when we discussed about this idea of *impact
science*, he got tired of being the scribe, the witness, of the marine
destruction, so he left academia and started a journey driven by the
compass of impact, not only knowledge creation. He led a project to
create the business model concept of “Fish Bank”[5]. The basic idea
being that the reduced profits of not catching fish on these protected
areas are vastly compensated by the fish caught overflowing around that
area. Moreover, one can include extra benefits setting up sustainable
tourism alongside the reserve; that now also harbors more biodiversity.
Enric presented this business model with specific simulations and
potential pilot sites, but also took into account the economic
incentives, financial mechanisms, and politic arguments to align all the
incentives from all stakeholders. And indeed, the coauthors of the
paper, alongside academics, are a Minister of Foreign Affairs of
Netherlands, a World Bank expert, an executive of an insurance company,
and an environmental activists. Armed with this multi-stakeholder
argument, in parallel, he scoped an action plan. He joined forces with
the National Geographic to brand a series of expeditions to pristine
oceans. He also had to find a set of donors and benefactors to support
the activities financially. These donors and collaborators included the
actor Leonardo di Caprio. Enric then used all that economic, financial,
narrative, and visual leverage, combined with a thick stack of academic
papers, and the sustainability model, to lobby governments to protect
the oceans. While it is hard to directly link the protection of seas to
a particular advocacy group, this project (called “Pristine Seas”) has
made twenty-six expeditions, countless numbers of incredibly powerful
videos, data for many academic papers, and was also involved in the
creation of eighteen marine reserves, and an extra five million square
km of sea protected (an area larger than the European Union).
