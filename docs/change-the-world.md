# Teaching how to Change the World

Virtually all scientists come from academic institutions, such as
universities. However, most universities only train research scientists,
with little space for non-research career paths, this is especially the
case for “pure sciences” like physics, biology, chemistry, or math.
Usually there are a few sessions about other careers, programs to
transfer into, other degrees such as journalism or teaching, but usually
this is the exception rather than a possible option. Most scientists we
can identify today as impact scientists, are more the result of a path
that started in universities, perhaps includes some graduate or
postgraduate experience, but then felt their path was not leading in the
right direction of impact, so they had to steer off into the unknown. It
often includes a phase of uncertainty or reconversion, and definitely
was not something recommended when studying. Thankfully, this is
changing. This change was probably helped both by the “Data Science”
revolution, but also the millennial generation, known for being
particularly minded about social impact[27], getting to university age.
This section explores some of these efforts from the educational space
to create the profile of a scientist much closer to impact, not only
focused on research or academia.

One of the most prominent examples of educational efforts is precisely
the class where Jane Chane started working on the Embrace company we
wrote about in the last chapter. At Stanford, the university where it
happens, it is called the “D School,” or “Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design at Stanford University.” Besides fostering the creation of Jane’s
solution Embrace, they are also known for the creation of “d.light,” a
company that creates a very low-cost solar-powered artificial lights.
This company started in 2006, the year before Jane took the class. By
2017 they had “sold close to twenty million solar light and power
products in 62 countries, improving the lives of over 82 million
people,” according to their website.

“D School” has become a hugely demanded class at Stanford. Increasingly
globally-minded students, also knowledgeable in complex science and
technology skills, look to make a difference in the world. They are
aware of the potential they might be able to have, but feel unable to
connect their skills with these multi-dimensional complex challenges.
The process in this class, as described by David Kelly in a 2013 New
York Times profile[28], is first to boost their “creative confidence”
so that they are aware of this potential. They then learn “ideation
processes,” where rapid prototyping and user feedback become key
strategies to incorporate their scientific and technical skills into
this creative confidence.

Another place catering to this impact science demand is a class called
“How to change the world” at the University College in London´s
Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Public Policy. This
class occurs once a year and lasts for two weeks. In 2017, when I met
its director, Dr. Jason Blackstock, it attracted 700 students across the
sciences to include engineering, chemistry, computer science. They are
all met by 65 experts from the public and private sector, and presented
with global challenges, such as safe water drinking in refugee camps, or
reducing carbon dependence in everyday products[29]. The first week is
structured to push them from the overall context of the challenge
towards a concrete part they are uniquely positioned to make an impact,
gathering in groups with different skills; which might include
partnering with external experts. The design of this class favors groups
with a wide range of skills and experiences, and with a clear goal. In
the end, not only do they experience the process of realizing the value
of the scientific and technical skills, but also how hard it is to
integrate this into the complex reality of global challenges, with their
political, cultural, or strategic dimensions. The underlying strategy of
the university is to foster impact by easing the links and partnership
building skills of students between academia, policy-making, and
industry.

As hinted by the example of these two schools, every year there is more
attention to widen the mindset of how science influences society.
Obviously via academia and research, but there is much more space to
drive positive impact in the world with scientists. One way of looking
the difference between academia or research, and impact science is to
see the focus of these new schools on “pulling” from the specific impact
they seek to have, rather than “pushing” academically trained scientists
or academic knowledge into impact. One of the key differences is that
when you push, you need to know more or less which direction and what
knowledge you are going to be pushing. When you pull, the goal is much
clearer by definition, and it is much easier to explore and guide what
is it you need to consider or incorporate to get the solution. You could
push, for example, the knowledge of new lithium batteries into climate
change, and we should. You can also think of energy use and seek how
pull solutions, either being new batteries, consumption incentives, or
work with biggest consumers. We tend to think of, and train for,
scientists and their skills in the first case, but not so much for the
second case, even when their skills are equally applicable.

Moreover, this is not just about getting scientists to explore other
domains, to reach out into problems whose knowledge domain seems far
away, or to incentive interdisciplinary scientists. There are far too
many combinations of disciplines in science to cover all combinations
that might get to a particular solution. This is still a “push” mindset.
This is about radically flip the equation, from knowledge-based value,
to skills-based value. To create a work space when, given a concrete set
of very pragmatic and convoluted problems, we can cluster experts and
stakeholders together, and then combine in equal terms the inputs from
each one, including impact scientists, so we can get to a solution. This
is exactly what can explain the creation, and explosive growth of “Data
Science,” as we pointed out in the Introduction section of this book.
Data scientists pull from the questions they need to answer. They use
formal mathematics, models, hypothesis—but all with the mindset of
pulling this work into an answer. In fact, one of the biggest risks for
a data scientist, or working with big data, is not having a concrete
question and spending too much time looking for interesting questions
one might solve with the data. While this is great for academic
curiosity, the incentive of the private sector is probably in supporting
decision making, not supporting curiosity. This mindset on skill-based
value is so dominant, that there is a boom in schools of data science
where they directly teach these formerly academic skills. While most of
these cater the specifics of tech companies and start-ups, there is a
wide range of those who seek wider impact with data science. To name two
examples: “Fast.ai” and “Data Science for Social Good”. “Fast.ai” is a
company dedicated to teaching machine learning so that is understood by
as many people as possible, with a special emphasis on social problems
and diversity. It is led by Rachel Thomas, a PhD in mathematics turned
data scientist, and Jeremy Howard a self-thought machine learning expert
and data scientist. The second example, “Data Science for Social Good,”
is a course at the University of Chicago which also teaches data
science, but specifically for its application on social problems, with a
strong emphasis on working with real projects with partnerships with
NGOs, local governments, or international institutions such as the World
Bank. This project is led by Rayid Ganhi, a former data scientist of the
Obama campaign who saw the power of data science skills and decided to
work with scientists to focus this potential into positive social
impact.
