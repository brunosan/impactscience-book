# How do we get there, Handbook for Scientists and Managers

Getting a grasp of the concept of “Impact Science” has been a long path. When I left academia, it was a difficult choice, and remained for many years a challenging time of uncertainty whether I had done the right thing. Looking back at those times I wish I knew that there is a professionally-viable, market-growing, and extremely interesting world of science outside academia. I wish I knew leaving academia doesn´t mean giving up the “top choice”, or that doing that did not mean that I was not good enough. I felt, and was told by a famous political scientist, that Society had “invested in me” with a lot of specialized education and I was not using it as I should. That from a public policy sense, I was a wasted investment. Beyond that, I had no idea what else I could do, where to do it, or how to make that transition happen. This made me feel anxious and frustrated. Moreover, the longer a scientist remains in academia, the harder this transition is. The cost of facing uncertain rules of your professional value or losing the status one has achieved despite the hardships of academia. These can be very hard moments. I can count more than a handful of known colleagues who once were good or really good academics, and faced with this change, they turned into a spiral of medicated depressions, clinical anxiety, unmet expectations and the more severe cases periods of professional help at mental health institutions or even struggling with suicidal thoughts. That deep the brand of academia defines success as a scientist. I have since discovered a lot of people craved and found other ways to be a successful scientist by being what we would call Impact Scientists.

There are two main reasons I wrote this book. One is that I believe Impact Science is a new concept that is both needed and unknown, perhaps even undefined. Many stories show this trend. On both sides, when it is needed and successfully used, and when it could have been used and didn´t, or it failed when applied. That is the first part of this book, up to this chapter. The second reason is to write the book I wish I had, back when I left academia. This last section of the book is meant for all those who have an academic background but feel something is missing. They still want to be scientists, but don´t find their place in . Or their friends and family, that want to understand the reason, and path, for such an uncommon and dramatic change from a “normal” scientist. These impact scientists wish to engage more with the world beyond academic articles or public outreach articles. They are tired of the pressures and uncertainties of the academic life and cycle of temporal postdocs, moving countries every two years or so, but they truly don´t know how to even think of alternatives. This chapter builds in a good part on my own experience and motivations, but it also includes the external perspectives from each of my bosses and managers since I left academia. I traveled to sit down with each of my bosses years after we worked together: at my last academic postdoc, the CEOs of the NGOs and the startups I worked at, and my World Bank manager. I wanted to understand what they saw different in my profile or attitude. If this is a typical transition from academia to Impact Science, I´m trying to understand what is different, and what was good and what was bad at each step. To accumulate more than my anecdotal evidence, I have also travelled the world for 2 years to more than 20 countries testing my hypothesis of Impact Science as a consultant, and to interview academics, employees, managers, investors, and politicians that are, or work with, academics that have left academia, or wanted to. It also draws from the feedback of talks and events I´ve helped with this thinking about Impact Scientist as a career choice, including a session at my PhD institution on the 10-year anniversary of finishing; and mentees I have helped throughout these years. Lastly, I have been very deliberate seeking continuous feedback on this book from the earliest drafts. I have registered and integrated all this feedback and continue to do so through its website. Feedback from readers is always welcomed.
