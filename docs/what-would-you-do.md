# What would you do?
Another practical way to explain the value of impact science that I have
used on my workshops and courses is to explore pragmatism and impact via
hypothetical scenarios. Some situations have a clear answer, some not,
but in either case, it helps exemplify the rounding up of skills
highlighted on the previous section.

#### The celebrity boost

In the summer of 2018 I had the chance to visit a very important
international research institution on climate change and the
environment. The group I was with included some other fellow scientists
but interestingly it also included “media celebrities” and award-winning
journalists from major international newspapers. People with truly tens
of millions of followers who trust them in social media. People whose
every online update is instantly read, shared, and commented on. If we
want impact with science, it is an interesting and relevant question how
scientist could or should relate with that kind of power. For example,
should some scientists become media celebrities? How do we partner with
them to help drive this impact?.

The director of the research institution we were visiting gave a
not-so-short speech about the kind of research that was done there: Many
nations present, many open questions to research, many important papers,
doctorates, and research ongoing around us. Very interesting indeed, but
probably with a bit too much detail for some of the audience. A
journalist from a major international newspaper, jumped with the golden
question of this hypothetical scenario: “If you could share a simple
message with the world to help improve the situation, what would it be?”
Indeed. This is a question many researchers get when they are
interviewed in the context of an important discovery, or around a public
outreach talk. Having also media celebrities on the room, made me think
even deeper about this scenario. Between journalists and researchers
there tends to be a natural tension between the scientist wanting
factual reporting with all nuisances and caveats, and the journalist
wanting a succinct clear headline that will be read, and cared, by
everyone.

With celebrities and the so-called influencers, there might even be a
bigger tension with scientists. In the traditional image of research and
academia, facts are the light of progress. Hard learned tools of
research leading to hard earned facts. The more facts one can uncover,
the better we are. Facts carry their own weight, and fact are enough. If
only more people knew them, the world would be better. Therefore, either
you should discover the facts for yourself thereby becoming an expert,
or otherwise non-experts should just listen to experts so that we all
knew better and can be better. This paternalistic approach is the
“information deficit” hypothesis most scientists assume truth. For
celebrities the model is radically different: paying attention has a
high cost, especially around topics one doesn’t care at first. We seek
to associate with others we can trust, we identify with, or would like
to. In essence, we seek to belong to groups of common identity, real or
desired. Moreover, given the cost of attention and thinking, we are
naturally good at choosing to make decisions with as little information
as possible. For that we use assumptions, heuristics, stereotyping, or
we follow what the leader says. This is sometimes called the
“low-information rationality” hypothesis, and while extremely common and
effective, it is dangerous since it disfavors fact-based reasoning. Yet,
we all have a set of famous people we follow, care, and listen to. The
somewhat uncomfortable reality is that an influencer or celebrity post
reaches within seconds an audience that the most important *Nature*
article will never reach. One might argue that it is as important to
generate knowledge as it is to have it known and acted upon by as many
people as possible. This is partly why organizations like the UN or the
EU have “Goodwill ambassadors” to promote children´s rights and use the
notability of these celebrities to drive media and political attention.
These include Antonio Banderas for UNDP, Shakira for the UN, Messi for
UNICEF or Angelina Jolie for UNHCR[31].

Back to our case, the director of this research institution we were
visiting, when asked about what he would say on climate change to
millions of people, his answer was:

*“Don´t trust what anyone says, including me. Make your own
conclusions.”*

Squarely hitting the target on the “information deficit” hypothesis
scientists tend to follow, and squarely missing the target of the
“low-information rationality” hypothesis celebrities tend to follow. I
truly don’t know what would I say, and I believe it is a good exercise
to think about this case, or more in general how we can leverage the
power of facts and fame, how they interact or can they work together.
May be the answer is closer to a succinct phrase that hits both targets
of low-information rational and hints towards learning more. I don’t
know the answer for climate change, but in nutrition, I believe Michael
Pollan hits the right spot with his book *In Defense of Food*[32]. The
whole book tries to drive this narrow space between pragmatic advice and
critical thinking, and he explicitly addressed the point of this section
on his first phrase, with an advice that summarized the book: “*Eat
food, not too much, mostly plants.*” The rest of the book is dedicated
to unfolding this phrase into logic, research, facts, history, and
recommendations. He, too, could have said about food, “Don´t trust what
anyone says, including me. Make your own conclusions,” but that phrase
gives both concrete direction easy to follow and nudges the reader to
want to know more.

Back to our research director, after the rounds of questions about
climate change research and impact, and his answers, I approached him,
and I told him about the idea of impact science, about the fact that
some in the room were celebrities, and a little bit about what I
described here on leveraging their reach. His refined answer was,
“Diversity, we need diversity in the world, and if we are not careful,
we will lose it.” I like this answer more, and so did the celebrity I
talked to afterwards. Still, she didn´t post it. I don´t know what I
would say, but it would probably be something like: “There is no away
when you throw away, the smoke that goes up, comes down somewhere else.
Reduce what you use, avoid plastics, recycle, choose the better option.”
I am sure there are better things to say. The question is then for you.
Think of the most famous person you follow, and imagine they ask you.
What would you say to millions of people?

#### Mr. President, this is what you will do

Often, when we look for impact we look at our leaders, our presidents,
head of state or elected politicians. They are seen as the enabler or
blocker to action, especially in issues like climate change. As I
explained on previous chapters there is huge, and growing, pile of
academic evidence that the global climate system is disrupted by our
actions, and we must change course. On my talks I often start with this
hypothetical scenario. You are sitting down with your heads of state, or
your city major. Think personally of them and of you, not a hypothetical
unknown leader. It might a very progressive democratic leader, or the
impulsive dictator of your country. You happen to be on the table in the
morning and she or him turns to you and says, “What do I do?” and you
answer, *“This is what I think you should do: …”* Depending on where you
are from, the baggage that comes with this question is very different.
Maybe you live on a very intense car culture, or there are big factories
around, or your electricity comes from burning gas or coal, or the
opposition leader is a climate change denier, or there is really no
budget left for expensive new programs.

You cannot tell them to read the latest papers, or the latest hefty IPCC
synthesis report with hundreds of pages or general recommendations. If
you are on the table with them, it is probably your job to read it,
absorb it and then come up with solutions. Depending on your location,
it might easier of harder to figure out what kind of action they should
embark on, but what is very clear is that this advice better considers
all those aspects of finance, politics, strategy. You can write them
down, think of the possible counter responses for your particular
location. This hopefully uncomfortable meeting is exactly the kind of
process an impact scientist should face, in this case helping translate
the academic findings into policy on the ground. There should be
tensions, disagreement, no easy answers, and hard challenges in the
process. Furthermore, the most important moment is probably when there
are things that are academically needed but the leader chooses not to
do. In the end it is their role and responsibility to decide, not yours.
Your role then is to accept this and, if possible, understand why, so
next time we can present a better solution that can be implemented.

When I was at the World Bank, I had a meeting with its president around
our approach for an upcoming key event. I presented my advice, he heard
it, and he told me he disagreed for a set of reasons he mentioned. I
tried to push back, but he told me not to, the decision was taken. I
needed to accept it and reflect on the decision. He was kind to explain
the reasons, he doesn’t need to, and may there were others he didn’t
mention, but somewhere there was something I was not understanding or
not seeing. Either way, my role is then to accept it, incorporate the
decision into the general approach and move on. This is what we did and
we kept working and agreeing on other aspects. In the private sector,
this is sometimes called “disagree and commit.” You should voice your
disagreement, but then you should also be able to commit to the
executive decision even when it is not the way you would do it. In
academia, disagreement is stubborn. We are encouraged to debate so we
can find the root of it, and either agree or find ways to solve the
disagreement. When leaders make decisions, they can have huge impact,
and whether they were right or wrong have many more dimensions than
objective data or academic debate. In these cases, it is both important
and difficult to offer our most reality grounded advice for that
particular scope, more than it is to be academically correct.

So, in your local context, for the particular issue at hand, complete
the phrase: *“Dear President, this is what I think you should do: …”*
