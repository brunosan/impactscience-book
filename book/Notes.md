1. It’s a known fact that the retreat is because of the effects of climate change.  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Vieli/publication/235640596_Large-scale_changes_in_Greenland_outlet_glacier_dynamics_triggered_at_the_terminus/links/54200b420cf241a65a1afaf0/Large-scale-changes-in-Greenland-outlet-glacier-dynamics-triggered-at-the-terminus.pdf  ^1
2. It’s more than just breath ancient air, the bubbles gives us a lot of information about evolution of the ice and its history. https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/207477CB49617C926A111C331AA69F4A/S002214300001279Xa.pdf/significance_of_air_bubbles_in_glacier_ice.pdf ^2
3. The documentary “Bending the arch” depicts this progress, from setting the organization to when he joined the World Bank Group as president. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending_the_Arc
4. http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/27/is-jim-yong-kim-destroying-the-world-bank-development-finance/
5. The original paper describing the business model and several potential areas for implementation was published in 2016, and available here https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X16300586 Enric has also spoken about the concept on several Ted talks and interviews.
6. The phrase, coined in 1994, refers to much more than profit and loss, to full cost accounting. http://www.johnelkington.com/archive/TBL-elkington-chapter.pdf ^6
7. Bhutan is a small community with a strong national identity and union. This means that, despite long windy roads and times to connect across the country, communities are closely united. My experience was that everyone knew someone in the region or place you were asking about for the mapping exercise; or the knew exactly who to call. As way of reference, this is reflected e.g. on this interview about soccer https://www.npr.org/2015/03/17/393646668/bhutan-one-step-closer-to-world-cup-after-shocking-victory-over-sri-lanka?t=1535798543478 ^7
8. There are many reported cases of misuse of mosquito nets used for fishing, not only around the Malawi lake, but also other regions. This is a good summary of the situation, in 2016 https://e360.yale.edu/features/misuse-of-malaria-fighting-mosquito-nets-stressing-lake-malawi-fish-populations

10. Famous last words, but as of end of 2022 at least 62% of the world is vaccinated, some countries with universal programs of several boosters to vulnerable population. At the same time more countries are classifying it as endemic and not imposing compulsory vaccination, social distancing or masks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory
11. There are multiple proposed explanations for how SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into, and evolved adaptations suited to, the human population. There is significant evidence and agreement that the most likely original viral reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 is horseshoe bats. In addition to direct spillover, another pathway, considered highly likely by scientists, is that of transmission through an intermediate host. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19

13. This is an example of such a case where a single traditional funeral of a prominent individual directly infected 28 other people. It should be noted that the traditions of this location involved touching the corpse of the deceased person.   https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6508a2.htm
14. It is still early to see the long-term effects of long lockdowns and isolation, but there are several sound hypothesis of the mechanism, and several studies underway. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/16/how-will-isolation-affect-long-term-immunity
15. See article on the scurvy here, and references therein: https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8852139/Mayberry.html
16. The time of HIV/AIDS cases is a well-researched topic, with many nuisances and complexities, like the different types of HIV, the effect of public policies, the inter-relation with the socio-economic, cultural and political factors of each country. For this part I based my research in sources quoted on Wikipedia articles, this article about relation of gay sexual practices https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8030625 . the book “The Band Played on” and this article about possible sources of the USA being hit particularly hard and fast: https://newrepublic.com/article/117691/aids-hit-united-states-harder-other-developed-countries-why
17. Estimates for how many people received contaminated Factor VIII range substantially, and also across many countries. This also includes spreading of other diseases, like Hepatitis C. References to estimates and disputes around these cases can be found e.g. here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products#cite_note-NYTimes1996-1

24. Google paid for “Deep Mind” $500 million. Google then reported a 40% saving in cooling costs. Bloomberg estimates an energy bill of ~4 million MWh, which yields potentially ~100M in annual savings. [Accessed on August 2020]  https://9to5google.com/2016/07/20/google-deep-mind-energy-savings/
25. In May 2017 Nature published a study on the detection of increasing CFC-11 with unknown origin. This is still research in progress and unknown if the source CFC is newly made or the leakage of stored appliances, but the findings are conclusive of an increased emission in the recent years that. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0106-2.epdf

27. The good news of reduced child mortality across the World is one of the key messages Dr. Hans Rossling became famous for. For more context-setting and the relation with education and development in general, his TED talk is a good pointer for more information: [ Accessed in May,2018 ] https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_good_news_of_the_decade

29. At the time of the acquisition, the so-called deep artificial intelligence applied on images was on its earliest stages. Today these features are much common. I learned about the backstory of Magic Pony and how it came to be from one of the VC funders, and was widely reported in 2016: https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/twitter-is-buying-magic-pony-technology-which-uses-neural-networks-to-improve-images/

38. Visual behaviors, such as a shift in one's gaze or a prolonged stare, can be diagnostic of internal thoughts.
