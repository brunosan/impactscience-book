### The Science of getting to radical social and environmental breakthroughs.


Why would a NASA rocket scientist move to Bhutan to plant hazelnuts? How could something as complex as the Ozone hole chemistry lead to the Montreal Protocol, in the words of the UN Secretary General, "The single most successful international agreement?” How can we know so much about climate change and yet fail to move forward? How could basic physics of melting wax save the lives of thousands of babies worldwide?

We have more scientists than ever before, more data than we ever dreamed, and technology in every aspect of life. And yet, with all of the wealth of facts, it seems there is still a stark polarization of opinions and paralysis of action. What is missing? This book explores, via stories of both success and failure, the weakening link between the research-driven scientists focused on understanding and creating knowledge, and the role of scientists integrating an impact-driven attitude. Scientists are good with data, but it is not just about data; it is what we do with it. Facts do not change the world—people do.

He was also Mirzayan Science Policy Fellow of the US National Academies of Science, and a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum. He was a member of the Global Future Council on Space. He has served on the advisory boards for companies, government bodies, and NGOs—including Inmarsat Development Program, the UAE Statistical Authority, and IamtheCode.

Bruno combines professional experience in academia, private sector, NGOs, and the public sector. At the World Bank’s Innovation Lab, their team led the Institution's Big Data work. He has been postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics on NASA satellites and rockets. At climate change NGO “Gain” he was Director of Science. He was Chief Scientist at high-growth startup Mapbox in Silicon Valley and later Vice President for Social Impact at the satellite company Satellogic.
